## 📌 About the Project  
Ozco Studio is my personal portfolio website where I explore, learn, and showcase my work as a developer. It serves as both an **experimental playground** and a **professional portfolio**, allowing me to continuously enhance my skills in **technology, design, and web development**.  

The site is built from scratch using core web technologies and is designed with a clean, modular structure — ready to evolve as I grow.

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Core web stack)  
- **Responsive Design** for all devices  
- **Clipboard Copy Function** to easily share contact details  
- **JSON-Based Content System** for loading dynamic project data  
- **JavaScript Modules** to handle multilingual and modular content  

## ✅ Features  
✔️ Interactive and minimalist UI  
✔️ Contact form with real-time validation ✉️  
✔️ Smooth scrolling and subtle animations 🎨  
✔️ Footer with social links and visitor info  
✔️ **Card-based project layout** 🏗️
